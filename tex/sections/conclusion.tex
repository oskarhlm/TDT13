This paper addressed the shared task on \acrlong{acr:smg} from VarDial 2020 and 2021, and shows that newer language-specific \acrlongpl{acr:lm} are very capable of predicting latitude/longitude pairs from text samples, obtaining a median error of 15.76 kilometers on the Swiss task. It also suggests that using metric \acrlongpl{acr:crs} could be better for what becomes a double regression problem. The best model achieved what would have been a second place in the \citeyear{gamanReportVarDialEvaluation2020} competition.

Further research should look into using a classifier based upon the \textbf{\acrshort{acr:bert}\textsubscript{LARGE}} base model. As of \today, there is no such model pre-trained on Swiss corpora known to the author of this paper. Having twice as many encoder layers as the \textbf{\acrshort{acr:bert}\textsubscript{BASE}} model, it should be able to pick up on finer dialectal details, if pre-trained.
