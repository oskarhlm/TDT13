This paper addressed the shared task on \acrlong{acr:smg} from VarDial 2020 and 2021, and shows that newer language-specific \acrlongpl{acr:lm} are very capable of predicting latitude/longitude pairs from text samples, obtaining a median error or 15.76 kilometers on the Swiss task. It also suggests that using metric \acrlongpl{acr:crs} could be better for what becomes a double regression problem in the geographic realm. The best model achieved what would have been a second place in the original competition.

Further reasearch should look into using classifier based upon the \textbf{\acrshort{acr:bert}\textsubscript{LARGE}} base model. As of \today there is no such model fine-tuned on Swiss corpera known to the author of this paper. Being twice as large as the \textbf{\acrshort{acr:bert}\textsubscript{BASE}} model it should be able to pick up on finer dialectal details, if fine-tuned.
