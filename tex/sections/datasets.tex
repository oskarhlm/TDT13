\section{Datasets}
\label{sec:datasets}

Data from VarDial 2020 and 2021 was acquired from a GitHub repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/yvesscherrer/vardial-shared-tasks}} created by Yves Scherrer's, co-author of the winning solution for the \gls{acr:smg} task, both years. All but the test dataset has a ground truth associated with it, and I assume this unlabelled test dataset was used for a private leaderboard. The training, development, and test gold datasets have 22600, 3097, and 3068 labelled samples, respectively. \autoref{tbl:train-dataset} shows the first five rows of the training dataset. It was collected by \cite[2-3]{hovyCapturingRegionalVariation2018} using the (at the time) publicly available Jodel API.

While Switzerland is a country with four official languages (Swiss-German, French, Italian, and Romansh Grishum), the dataset contains only Swiss-German Jodel messages, focusing on dialectal differences (the "Dial" in VarDial). This results in the heatmap in \autoref{fig:heatmap}.

Attepmts were made to aquire a Norwegian dataset based on Norwegian Twitter/X messages using the method described in \cite{ljubesicTweetGeoToolCollecting2016} but due to recent changes in the Twitter/X API\footnote{\url{https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/31/23739084/twitter-elon-musk-api-policy-chilling-academic-research}} I was unable to do this. I also explored the possibility of using Norwegian Jodel messages but to my knowledge their API is no longer available to the public.
